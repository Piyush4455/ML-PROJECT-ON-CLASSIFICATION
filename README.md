# ML-PROJECT-ON-CLASSIFICATION
We are given a dataset and from that we are predicting the status of the adults either they fall under the Rich or Poor category using classification Machine Learning Algorithms


We checked the model with 2 classification algorithms i.e Logistic Regression and Decison Tree and we got the acuraccy as 83% and 81% respectively.

And in the end of each algorithm we are calculating the confusion matrix for each of the algo's 

And in this model we were more focused toward False Negative and Decision Tree gave less False Negative as compared to the Logistic Regression. So Decision Tree give more optimised results for dataset.
